# React Weather App

This project is primarily meant for me to fiddle around with ReactJS.

## Idea

I want to create a simple weather app using the [open-meteo] weather API as a backend. The app should allow the user to enter a city or manually provide latitude and longitude coordinates and then display the current weather as well as the temperature of the next 5 days.

## Usage

I've created a custom webpack/babel configuration to serve my react application, to preview this you'll need to clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/TiesDO/react-weatherapp
```

And then install the dependencies with node package manager:

```
npm install
```

After the dependencies have been installed you can start the project by running:

```
npm start
```

## Structure

For the time being I have opted to structure my project the following way:

```
